This is a flying robot that I just shot out of the sky when it tired to deliver me a package.
Is Star Wars the one with the wizard boy?
They do seem to, as they say, keep it "100."
You think I would carry around pictures of my child where anyone could see them?
Sure I loved shutting things down, bleeding the beast from the inside...
I was going to ask you for a job. In the federal government - even saying it feels dirty.
That's the real reason I hired you. Those brownies were damn good.
I'll do anything! I'll watch a foreign film! I'll talk to a man with a ponytail!
I would rather bleed out than sit here and talk about my feelings for 10 mins.
I'm going to break out of here, then I'm going to snap you in half.
This is a competition. We need to win it. Please do your jobs.
It's f*cking milk.
I prefer quality over flash - that's why I refuse to write my signature in cursive.
Tammy does not abide by the Geneva Convention.
Yes, the sky has land.
Live your life how you want, but don’t confuse drama with happiness.
Hello, Joe. My name is Ron Swanson. I am Donna’s work-proximity associate.
I don’t drink alcohol from that portion of the color system.
On nights like this when the cold winds blow, the air is awash in the swirling eddies of our dream, come with me and find safe haven in a warm bathtub full of my jazz.
He now has that look that only comes with the pride of labor. Or…he pooped. Either way, I’ve never been prouder.
My son is several weeks old. He is very familiar with the sound of power tools.
I’d like to introduce you to my son. John, middle name redacted, Swanson.
Veganism is the sad result of a morally corrupt mind. Reconsider your life.
Dear frozen yogurt, you are the celery of desserts. Be ice cream or be nothing.
Computers are mostly pointless, but that Yelp thing gave me a great idea on how to criticize people in places.
Children are terrible artists and artists are crooks.
There has never been a sadness not cured by breakfast food.
Tom put all my records into this rectangle!
I believe luck is a concept invented by the weak to explain their failures.
I will leave my children $50 a piece. Enough for the cab ride home from the funeral and a steak dinner. End of discussion.
I've had the same will since I was 8 years old. Upon my death, I will transfer all of my belongings to the man or animal who has killed me.
Ron Swanson: Ron.Ron Don: Ron.Ron Swanson: Last name?Ron Done: Done.Ron Swanson: Is that your name or are you telling me you're finished talking?Ron Done: Both.Ron Swanson: Done and Done.
Lookâ€”a clock. We don't have that in America. You call that a tower? Try the Sears Tower, friend.
History began July 4th, 1776. Anything before that was a mistake.
Great job, everyone. The reception will be held in each of our individual houses, alone.
I warned you. Standard birth control methods are usually ineffective against a Swanson.
I believe in cutting useless government projects. I also believe in cutting useful government projects.
Normally, if given the choice between doing something and doing nothing, I'll do nothing. But I will do something if it helps someone else do nothing. I'd work all night if it meant that nothing got done.
What's cholesterol?
I'll represent myself as I do in all legal matters and livestock auctions.
I wish this office had only walls.
People who buy things are suckers.
Before we go in there, I want to say something. You are a wonderful person. Our friendship means a lot to me. And you look very beautiful.
Your house isn't haunted. You're lonely.
The next thing you'll want to do is ditch the terrier and get yourself a proper dog. Any dog under 50 pounds is a cat and cats are pointless.
I wouldn't know. I've never been hungover. After I've had too much whiskey, I cook myself a large flank steak, pan fried and salted butter. I eat that, put on a pair of wet socks and go to sleep.
I did not sleep for one second last night. And I cracked the bottom of the toilet bowl.
There's been a mistake. You've accidentally given me the food that my food eats.
I'm going to get 12 eggs and part of a dead animal. Dealer's choice. Please and thank you.
I love nothing!
Girls, this is Ann. Talk to Ann. She's terrific.
Son, there's no wrong way to consume alcohol.
It might be cold outside but it's about to get warm all up in my jazz.
This might be the first time I've ever wanted to attend an event.
Breakfast food can serve many purposes.
I'm giving you a non-electronic book made of paper from a tree.  It is called Auto Repair Manual-1982.  You will read this book from cover to cover then you will assist me in repairing the damage to my car.  I will not report you to the judge but if you slip up again you will have much more to fear than some feeble government employee in a robe.
Your work is appreciated. Eat some corn.
These people are meat virgins. They'll have been taken by the grill and delicately and tenderly been shown the ways of flavorful meat love. Mmmm...the first time is so beautiful.
In my opinion, not enough people have looked their dinner in the eyes and considered the circle of life. This is your dinner. His name is Tom.
Clear alcohols are for rich women on diets.
I have so many ideas. Some are simple like take down traffic lights and eliminate the post office. The bigger ones will be tougher, like 'bring all this crumbling to the ground.'
Anyone want to go to JJ's for some after dinner omelets?
I work hard to make sure my department is as small and as ineffective as possible.
Jerry's work is often adequate.
Never half ass two things, whole ass one thing.
I never thought I would say this to you son, but you may be over thinking this.
I hate riddles, and other such nonsense. I want that on record, but something wicked with a book is my ex-wife's library.
When I eat it is the food that is scared.
Straight down the middle, no hook, no spin, no fuss. Anything more and this becomes figure skating.
The important thing is the dam is never happening, and your dream has been crushed.
I don't want to paint with a broad brush here, but every single contractor in the world is a miserable, incompetent thief.
Tom, we're already late. Now be a man and sit on that girl's lap!
We need to get Leslie something that erases the enormous emotional debt that has built up over years of this gift-giving imbalance.
So it learns information about me?
Of all my coworkers he is one of a small number of whom I do not actively root against...uh, there I go again gettin' all sappy.
My first day of college my father dropped me off at the steel mill. He didn't think I should go to college, but I hitched a ride, enrolled, and learned a lot.
Every two weeks I need to sand down my toe nails.  They're too strong for clippers.
It is a beautiful night for the end of the world.
Leslie, NO! We use that stuff to burn warts off mules!
My first ex-wife's name is Tammy, my second ex-wife's name is Tammy. My Mom's name is Tamara... she goes by Tammy.
Tammy 1 is my blonde chicken.
I hope the rest of your day is cool beans.
I'm Ron Swanson and you're Leslie f***ing Knope.
I have cried twice in my life. Once when I was seven and I was hit by a school bus. And then again when I heard that Li'l Sebastian had passed.
I think if you would know one thing about me it would be that I prefer laying wreaths to lighting torches.
Hello Leslie, how long have you been sleeping with Ben?
Chris, you have come up with a plan so spectacularly horrible that it might ruin the entire department.
This is my favorite part about having a new city manager. They always try to shake things up and their ideas are terrible and it brings city hall to a grinding halt. I just grab a few donuts, sit back, and enjoy the show.
I don't like loud noises and people making a fuss. And I especially don't like people celebrating, because they know a piece of private information about me. Plus the whole thing is a scam. Birthdays were invented by Hallmark to sell cards.
It's never too early to learn that the government is a greedy piglet that suckles on a taxpayer's teet until they have sore, chapped nipples. I'm gonna need a different metaphor to give this nine year old.
I won't publicly endorse a product unless I use it exclusively and I really believe in it. My only official recommendations are US Army issued mustache trimmers, Morton's Salt, and the C.R. Lawrence fine two inch style oscillating knife blade.
I want this night to get krazy. Get me a shot of snake juice. I hear it has a dope aftertaste.
Leslie has a lot of qualities I find horrifying. But the worst one by far is how thoughtful she can be.
Everyone shut up and look at me!
Here's mine. It's a hamburger made out of meat on a bun with nothing. Add ketchup if you want I couldn't care less.
Listen, I've eaten a commissary hamburger for lunch every day for twelve years. I just wanted to make sure this pointless health crusade won't affect the only part of my job that I like.
"The key to burning an ex-wife effigy is to dip it in paraffin wax and then toss the flaming bottle of isopropyl alcohol from a safe distance. Do not stand too close when you light an ex-wife effigy."
"The dentist pulled the tooth out yesterday but it's always a good idea to demonstrate to your coworkers that you are capable of withstanding a tremendous amount of pain. Plus, it's always fun to see Tom faint."
What the fuck is a German muffin?!?
It's like yoga, except I still get to kill something.
All of you be quiet.  Andy, she's mad because you said "awesome sauce" instead of "I love you too."  April, he loves you. Stop being a child.  Tom, you're clearly at fault here.  Blaming Jerry won't save you.  Jerry, we both know you were shotgunning funnel cakes instead of watching Lil Sebastian.  So everyone apologize to everyone else.
When I'm done eating a Mulligan's meal, for weeks afterwards, there are flecks of meat in my mustache. And I refuse to clean it because every now and then a piece of meat will fall into my mouth.
Leslie, you need to understand that we are headed to the most special place on earth. When I'm done eating a Mulligan's meal, for weeks afterwards there flecks of meat in my mustache and I refuse to clean it because every now and then a piece of meat will fall into my mouth.
What happened to the steaks that were in there when they closed? (tearily) Do you think they got eaten?
Encapsulate the spirit of melancholy. Easy. Boom, a sad desk. Boom, sad wall. It's art. Anything is anything.
No, I don't care about their relationship. I just don't want to lose April. I would never be able to find a worst assistant.
Why are you working the permit's desk, and why was that child clubbing your nuggets?
I'm going to type every word I know! Rectangle. America. Megaphone. Monday. Butthole.
Took her home. Polished her up. Bought a brand new ribbon off of electronic bay dot com.
It's too bad. I just taught her how to whittel. She made me this tiny sharpened stick.
I am off to have a mid-morning pre-lunch with my lady friend, but I will be back in time for lunch.
My ex-wife Tammy likes to check in every so often and make sure I'm doing OK. And if I am, she tries to [expletive] everything up.
I like Andy. I'm surrounded by a lot of women in this department. And that includes the men.
You are an unstoppable good idea machine!
I need to find someone to fill in for April. Now I know I'm not going to find someone who's both aggressively mean and apathetic. April really is the whole package.
The less I know about other people's affairs, the happier I am. I'm not interested in caring about people. I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name. Best friend I ever had. We still never talk sometimes.
OK, well I'm not very good at visiting people in hospitals, so I'm going to go
Here. I didn't know what to bring you, so I just got some magazines and lipstick. Woman stuff.
Under my tutelage, you will grow from boys to men. From men into gladiators. And from gladiators into Swansons.
Well, I am not usually one for speeches. So, goodbye.
I accidentally told them what you're doing in an attempt to save some government jobs. It's been a very strange day for me.
Right off the bat, we sell city hall. Let somebody turn it into a large gas station or a TJ Maxx.
I'm an official member of a task force dedicated to slashing the city budget. Just saying that gave me a semi.
Leslie, my first wife Tammy tried throwing me a surprise birthday party . When I saw my friends hiding through the window, I drove to a gas station, called the cops and told them people had broken into my home. I'm not big on surprises.
What's a not-gay way to ask him to go camping with me?
What exactly will you be cutting? And how much of it, and can I watch you do it while eating pork cracklings?
Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Don't teach a man to fish, and you feed yourself. He's a grown man. Fishing's not that hard.
I have to nap up. If I don't get a solid five, it kills my sunny disposition.
April was supposed to be the moat that kept the citizen barbarians away from Swanson castle. Instead she blew up the castle and stabbed me in the face.
Round up whoever's free. I'm going to need more Ron Swansons.
A schlemiel is the guy who spills soup at a fancy party. A schlamazel is the guy he spills it on. Jerry is both the schlemiel and the schlamazel of our office.
Those dates are arbitrary. They're like those expiration dates that the government forces companies to put on yogurt and medicine.
Hey, Mark. Welcome to my haven. You're the first non-me to set foot in this building in ten years.
Everything I do is the attitude of an award winner because I've won an award.
Which of these objects most represents women for this portrait? A pot? Or this deputy director Barbie? Isn't it adorable? She's got a little briefcase, her cell phone.
Be proud of yourself. You deserve an award. Not this one, obviously. This one belongs to me. But some other one. Some other lesser award.
Awards are stupid, which is why I fully intend to decline this nonsense and recommend it go to Leslie because she works really hard and I don't. However, she cares way too much about crap like this, which is why I can't pass up this opportunity to tease her about it.
If I wanted to bring a large number of deviled eggs, but I didn't want to share them with anyone else, can you guarantee fridge space?
The whole point of this country is if you want to eat garbage, balloon up to 600 pounds and die of a heart attack at 43, you can! You are free to do so. To me, that's beautiful.
After I got home, I drank six more glasses of whiskey and then I finished crafting this mall harp, using a bandsaw, a spokeshave and an oscillating spindle sander.
Swansons have a preternaturally high tolerance for alcohol. My old man used to put Wild Turkey on his cornflakes.
I think the entire government should be privatized. Chuck E. Cheese could run the parks. Everything operated by tokens. Drop in a token, go on the swing set. Drop in another token, take a walk. Drop in a token, look at a duck.
I wanna punch you in the face so bad right now.
OK good, because I have to run a public forum, supervise the maintenance crews and teach crafts at the senior center. Simultaneously.
We can't have raccoons for the Christmas thing.  They'll hunt the kids for sport.
My name is Ron.  You don't need to know my last name.  Whoever wants to talk, go ahead and we'll be out of here in a tight fifteen.
There's a bunch of messages waiting for you about a bunch of things I don't understand.
Take it down a notch. You already won your Oscar, DiCaprio.
Tom-cat, pull up a mouth. This buffet is unstoppable.
Strippers do nothing for me. I like a strong, salt of the Earth, self-possessed woman at the top of her field. Your Steffi Grafs, your Sheryl Swoopeses, but I will take a free breakfast buffet anytime, anyplace.
Looking at her, I feel like she might be the perfect spooning size for me.
They'll only talk to you or me. And I can't go, because I don't want to.
And just like that. The one tiny aspect of government I enjoyed was clubbed to death before my eyes.
I got my first job when I was 9. Worked at a sheet metal factory. In two weeks, I was running the floor. Child labor laws are ruining this country.
I'm a simple man. I like pretty, dark-haired women and breakfast food. But this stock photo I bought at a framing store isn't real. Today I got the real thing. A naked Tammy made me breakfast this morning. I should have taken a picture of it.
Look, Tammy and I don't work. We are oil and water. Or oil and TNT and C4 and a detonator and a butane torch.
So you talked to Tammy? What's it like to stare in the eye of Satan's butt hole?
On my deathbed, my final wish is to have my ex-wives rush to my side so I can use my dying breath to tell them both to go to hell one last time.
Ann, do you have any Mounds? Because all I can find are Almond Joys. And almonds give me the squirts.
I've established a scientifically perfect, ten-point scale of human beauty. Wendy is a 7.4, which is way too high for Tom, who is a 3.8. 10 is tennis legend Steffi Graf.
You know, Leslie, the Super Bowl is in a couple months.  I usually watch it with my brothers, maybe you can come by during halftime and shoot me in the head?
This is my basketball court. I don't want to see any double dribbles. I don't want to see any three second violations.
